# ðŸ›³ Installation

Linux & macOS. Windows is not supported. If you have problems installing please open an issue :)

Autorestic requires `curl`, `wget` and `bzip2` to be installed. For most systems these should be already installed.

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CupCakeArmy/autorestic/master/install.sh | bash
```

## Alternatives

### Manual

You can download the right binary from the release page and simply copy it to `/usr/local/bin` or whatever path you prefer. Autoupdates will still work.

### Brew

If you are on macOS you can install through brew: `brew install autorestic`.

### AUR

If you are on Arch there is an [AUR Package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/autorestic-bin/) by @n194.
